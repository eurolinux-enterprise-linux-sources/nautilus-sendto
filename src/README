***********************************

In order to be able to use of libsocialweb and share your files
(videos or images) using other social sharing technologies, you will
need to set up some libsocialweb accounts. So as to do this, download bisho
(MeeGo configuration tool for libsocialweb social network aggregator),
and use it to set up all your accounts. Once you have done this and
have restarted nautilus-sendto, you should be able to see the
configured accounts available for use.
